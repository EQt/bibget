BibGet
======

Retrieve and store PDF files via a bibtex file and Git-repository.

ToDos
-----

- [ ] Create a `setup.py`.
  This way, the repository would not need the git submodule, but could work as an ordinary script within the current working directory.

- [ ] Compare to [`bibtools`](https://github.com/pkgw/bibtools/tree/master/bibtools)

- [ ] Handlers.
  I could implement some Handler class, depending on a regular expression of the URL.
  This way, some websites could be filtered out.
  
- [ ] Integrate with DPLP
  See [`dblp-python`](https://github.com/scholrly/dblp-python) or
  the [DBLP API](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/13501473).
  
- [ ] Compare to [`scholar.py`] (Git submodule).
